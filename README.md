Due to proprietary reasons, we cannot release the source code of BI-REC or the Health Insights dataset as both are held by the patent rights under the ownership of IBM.

We make the GoSales dataset used in the paper publicly available. Besides the appendix available in the paper, following is the information provided that helps in the reproducibility of our system BI-REC.

### 1. /GoSales/Base-Ontology/

Under this folder, we have a file GOSALES_OLAP.owl which is the original ontology from the financial domain.

### 2. /GoSales/syntheticVocabulary/

The additional synthetic measure groups and measures introduced into the ontology help us create a large-scale ontology that help a comprehensive evaluation of BI-REC. This folder contains the files corresponding to the synthetic ontology concepts (measure groups and measures) and the enhanced vocabulary.
